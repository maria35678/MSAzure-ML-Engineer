# Machine Learning Engineer with Azure
To collect all of project materials from Machine Learning Engineer with Azure from Udacity

## Project 1 - [Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure](https://github.com/wasuratme96/MSAzure-ML-Engineer/tree/main/Optimize%20an%20Azure%20ML%20Pipeline)

In this project, I have created and optimize an ML pipeline by using custom training model script from Logistic Regression and perform hyperparameters tuning by HyperDrive. Comparing with AutoML to build and optimize the model. <br>

Both of pipeline will be compared and tracked on AzureML Studio.
